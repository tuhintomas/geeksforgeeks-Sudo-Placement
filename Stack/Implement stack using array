Implement a Stack using Array. Your task is to complete the functions below.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the stack)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from stack and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.

Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the stack is empty else the element poped out
from the stack .

Your Task:
You are required to complete two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack  and pop which
returns a integer poped out from the stack.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100

Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
4
2 1 4 1 5 2  

Output:
3 4
-1 5

Explanation:
In the first test case for query 
1 2    the stack will be {2}
1 3    the stack will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 3 the stack will be {2}
1 4    the stack will be {2 4}
2       poped element will be 4





class MyStack:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.arr=[]
    
    #Adds element to the Stack
    def push(self,data):
        #add code here
        self.arr.append(data)
    #Removes element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        #add code here
        if not self.arr:
            return -1
        else:
            return self.arr.pop()
