Given a number as string(n) , your task is to complete the function remainderWith7 which returns an integer which denotes
the remainder of the number when its divided by 7. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases then T test cases follow . Each test case contains 
a number represented as string.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the remainder when the number is divided by 7.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of n <=300

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
5
8
Output:
5
1






int remainderWith7(string n)
{   
    unsigned long long int x=0;
    
   for(int i=0;i<n.length(); i++){
       x=x*10+n[i]-'0';
       x=x%7;
   }
    
    return (x%7);
}





def remainderWith7(str):
    num=int(str)
    return num%7
