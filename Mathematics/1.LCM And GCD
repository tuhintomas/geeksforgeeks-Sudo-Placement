Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. In each test cases, 
there are two numbers A and B separated by space.

Output:
For each testcase in a new line, print LCM and GCD separated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= A <= 108
1 <= B <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
5 10
14 8

Output:
10 5
56 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: LCM and GCD of given numbers 5 and 10 are: 10 and 5.





def LCM_GCD(A,B):
    prod=A*B
    if A<B:
        A,B=B,A
    while A%B!=0:
        A,B=B,A%B
    gcd=B
    lcm=prod//gcd
    return [lcm,gcd]
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    [A,B]=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(" ".join(map(str,LCM_GCD(A,B))))
